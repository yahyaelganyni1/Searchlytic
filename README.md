# Searchlytic

Searchlytic is a Rails application designed to track, analyze, and optimize search behavior within your web application. It provides insights into user search patterns and helps improve search functionality through analytics.

## Core Features

- **Search Query Tracking**: Logs all search queries performed by users, including partial and final queries
- **Search Analytics**: Tracks user search patterns and provides analytics on popular search terms
- **Search Suggestions**: Offers search suggestions based on previous successful searches
- **Query Scoring**: Implements a scoring system to identify and highlight the most effective search terms

## How It Works

1. The application logs every search attempt, capturing:
   - Search queries
   - User IP address
   - Session information
   - Whether the query was a final submission

2. Search logs are tracked with a scoring mechanism that:
   - Increments scores for repeated queries
   - Identifies which searches lead to successful results
   - Highlights trending search terms

3. The system provides an API for:
   - Logging search queries
   - Retrieving search suggestions
   - Analyzing search patterns

## Technical Architecture

Searchlytic is built on Ruby on Rails and includes:

- **Models**: Articles and SearchLogs to track content and search behavior
- **Controllers**: Handle search queries and log user search patterns
- **Frontend Integration**: JavaScript controller for real-time search suggestions
